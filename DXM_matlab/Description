DXM (for Digital X Mapping)

DXM is a convenient tool dedicated to researchers in environmental sciences and for educational purposes. DXM aims to assist in analysing and quantifying time series with the help of non-stationary signal analysis methods. Starting from a loaded time series (whatever its length and time resolution), the software computes various maps and statistics related to variability and non-stationarity properties. Among others, it provides computations of Fourier and Autocorrelation spectra, SSA (Singular Spectrum Analysis), wavelet transforms, and DXM extended auto-correlations (cyclostationarity). 

The code presented here were developed in 2011 when I was working at the French Institute of Pondicherry, India under the supervision of Dr. CÃ©dric Gaucherl.

Since then, the software has been officially released by the French Umr AMAP and can be found here http://amap-collaboratif.cirad.fr/pages_logiciels/index.php?page=dxm
