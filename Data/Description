The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a naturally occurring phenomenon often thought as an irregular oscillator that swings between warmer than normal (El Nino) and cooler than normal (La Nina) tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SSTs). The phenomenon is known as a dominant source of interannual climate variability in the global climate system, causing variation in regional climate pattern often with global implications for socio-economic systems and the environment. 

The SOI, commonly used to quantify the atmospheric ENSO variations, is defined as the normalized sea-level atmosphere pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin, Australia. The data set used in this analysis is the monthly SOI time series from January 1933 though July 2011. A anomalously negative value of this index indicates a warm event (El Nino), while a highly positive value is associated with a cold event (La Nina). The oceanic component of ENSO is commonly quantified by the indexes Nino 1-2, Nino 3, Nino 4 and Nino 3.4 defined as the sea surface temperature (SST) averaged over the eastern half of the tropical Pacific, respectively located at (0N − 10S, 90E − 80W ), (5N − 5S, 150W − 90W ), (5N − 5S, 170E− 120W ) and (5N − 5S, 160E − 150W ). The time interval considered for the four indices is from January 1950 to July 2014. All data are based on the time series provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center (CPC). The data are normalized with respect to the standard deviation computed over the same interval to allow for a better comparison between time series.
